# scroll_speed
Script to change the scroll speed in Ubuntu (maybe other distros as well)


First run
sudo apt-get install imwheel zenity
Then simply execute the script, and it should give you a popup to set your scroll speed.

Note: lower numbers are better. It gets ridiculous after about 10 or so.
